# Provider Verification and Credentialing System

## Overview

The Provider Verification and Credentialing System is a comprehensive blockchain-based solution for managing healthcare provider credentials, verification status, and access control. This system ensures that only verified and credentialed healthcare providers can access patient health records.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### provider-verification.clar
The core smart contract that manages:
- Provider registration with credentials
- Credential verification and status tracking
- Provider suspension and reactivation
- Activity logging and access counting
- Credential type management

#### Enhanced access-control.clar
Updated to integrate with provider verification:
- Validates provider credentials before granting access
- Records provider activity automatically
- Supports granular access control with scope limitations

### Service Layer

#### ProviderVerificationService
TypeScript service that provides:
- Provider registration and credential management
- Real-time verification status checking
- Credential updates and renewals
- Suspension and reactivation workflows
- Integration with Stacks blockchain

### API Layer

#### Provider Routes
RESTful API endpoints for:
- `POST /api/v1/providers/register` - Register new providers
- `GET /api/v1/providers/{principal}/verify` - Verify provider status
- `GET /api/v1/providers/{principal}/credentials` - Get credentials
- `PUT /api/v1/providers/{principal}/credentials` - Update credentials
- `POST /api/v1/providers/{principal}/suspend` - Suspend provider
- `POST /api/v1/providers/{principal}/reactivate` - Reactivate provider

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Credential Management
- Support for multiple credential types (medical license, board certification, etc.)
- Expiration date tracking and automatic status updates
- Issuing authority verification
- Credential renewal workflows

### 2. Real-time Verification
- Instant provider verification status checking
- Integration with access control for automatic validation
- Activity tracking and audit trails

### 3. Flexible Suspension System
- Administrative suspension capabilities
- Reason tracking and documentation
- Reactivation workflows with proper authorization

### 4. Blockchain Security
- Immutable credential records on Stacks blockchain
- Cryptographic verification of provider identity
- Decentralized trust model

## Usage Examples

### Registering a New Provider

```typescript
import { ProviderVerificationService } from './src/services/verification/ProviderVerificationService';

const service = new ProviderVerificationService(contractAddress);

const registrationRequest = {
  providerPrincipal: 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM',
  licenseNumber: 'MD123456',
  credentialTypes: ['medical-license', 'board-certification'],
  expiresAt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60), // 1 year
  issuingAuthority: 'State Medical Board'
};

const result = await service.registerProvider(registrationRequest);
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Provider registered with transaction ID:', result.txId);
}
```

### Verifying Provider Status

```typescript
const verification = await service.verifyProvider(providerPrincipal);
if (verification.isVerified) {
  console.log('Provider is verified and active');
  console.log('Credentials:', verification.credentials);
} else {
  console.log('Verification failed:', verification.failureReason);
}
```

### Using API Endpoints

```javascript
// Register a provider
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/providers/register', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(registrationRequest)
});

// Verify a provider
const verification = await fetch(`/api/v1/providers/${principal}/verify`);
const verificationData = await verification.json();
```

## Credential Types

The system supports the following credential types:

- `medical-license` - Basic medical practice license
- `board-certification` - Medical board certification
- `hospital-privileges` - Hospital practice privileges
- `dea-registration` - DEA registration for controlled substances
- `npi-number` - National Provider Identifier
- `specialty-certification` - Medical specialty certifications
- `malpractice-insurance` - Malpractice insurance coverage
- `continuing-education` - Continuing education requirements
- `telemedicine-license` - Telemedicine practice license
- `research-certification` - Clinical research certifications

## Error Handling

The system uses standardized error codes:

### Smart Contract Errors
- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (300)` - Unauthorized operation
- `ERR-PROVIDER-NOT-FOUND (301)` - Provider not registered
- `ERR-INVALID-CREDENTIALS (302)` - Invalid credential data
- `ERR-CREDENTIALS-EXPIRED (303)` - Credentials have expired
- `ERR-PROVIDER-SUSPENDED (304)` - Provider is suspended
- `ERR-INVALID-CREDENTIAL-TYPE (305)` - Invalid credential type
- `ERR-PROVIDER-ALREADY-EXISTS (306)` - Provider already registered
- `ERR-INVALID-EXPIRY-DATE (307)` - Invalid expiration date

### Service Layer Errors
- Validation errors for required fields
- Network errors for blockchain communication
- Authentication errors for unauthorized access

## Security Considerations

### 1. Access Control
- Only authorized administrators can register providers
- Provider suspension requires proper authorization
- Credential updates are restricted to authorized entities

### 2. Data Integrity
- All credential data is stored on blockchain for immutability
- Cryptographic hashes ensure data integrity
- Audit trails track all modifications

### 3. Privacy Protection
- Sensitive credential data is properly encrypted
- Access logs maintain provider privacy
- Compliance with healthcare privacy regulations

## Integration with Access Control

The provider verification system seamlessly integrates with the existing access control system:

1. **Pre-Access Validation**: Before granting access to patient records, the system automatically verifies provider credentials
2. **Activity Tracking**: All provider access is logged and tracked for audit purposes
3. **Automatic Revocation**: Suspended or expired providers automatically lose access to patient records
4. **Scope Limitation**: Access can be limited based on provider credential types

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Smart Contract Tests**: Clarinet-based tests for all contract functions
- **Service Layer Tests**: Unit tests for all service methods
- **API Tests**: Integration tests for all API endpoints
- **Error Handling Tests**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain node access
- Clarinet for smart contract deployment
- Node.js environment for services

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy smart contracts using Clarinet
2. Configure service layer with contract addresses
3. Set up API endpoints with proper authentication
4. Initialize credential types and administrative accounts

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with external credential verification services
- Automated credential renewal notifications
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Multi-signature approval workflows
- Cross-chain credential verification
